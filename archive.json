Two bits are necessary to distinguish early data, client handshake, and application data during the handshake.  This might be reduced to a single epoch bit by using a full-sized record header for early data, doubling the sequence number space.\r\n\r\nThe remaining 11 bits are the lowest significant bits of the record sequence number.  This means that we could be tolerant of [reordering](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6250#section-3.1.8) of 1024 packets.  Assuming 1k packets, this would mean hugely divergent path characteristics, or 1Mb of BDP.  The tweak above for early data would double this, which might be a good idea (it might also be a good idea for other reasons, such as the ability to recognize early data that arrives before a handshake).",

      "body": "Using the TLS process for KeyUpdate - as the current draft does - leads to a suboptimal set of choices in implementations.\r\n\r\nSending KeyUpdate followed immediately by a key change means that KeyUpdate isn't a reliable indicator of a key change at the receiver.  If the record containing the KeyUpdate is lost, then the receiver will be unable to decrypt anything sent after it unless it looks at the epoch and tries the new keys.  That suggests a design much closer to the one in QUIC, where the KEY_PHASE bit (here, the low bit of the epoch) is the only signal of a key update.\r\n\r\nThe receiver could buffer those records, but I don't see why it would choose head-of-line blocking and a potentially-large memory commitment over trialing the new epoch.\r\n\r\nI would prefer a different design, even if it diverges from the TLS design.  \r\n\r\n1. That could be the same design as QUIC uses, with the epoch bit signaling intent.  The cost there is that you need to use the bit as an acknowledgment of a key update, so you end up having to keep key updates in lock step, even if no update is needed.  If there are asymmetric sending patterns, this isn't ideal.\r\n\r\n2. Wait until the KeyUpdate is acknowledged before installing new keys.  When KeyUpdate is received, the receiver installs new keys, but retains old keys on a timer (the holddown timer would do).  The sender waits for the ACK and starts using new keys when it sees it.  The cost here is that switching keys can't be immediate and it requires hooks into the ACK handling logic, neither of which is ideal.",

In QUIC, this is the server's job and there's no real way for the client to say that it doesn't have enough CIDs or tell the server how many. It can just say that it is done using some set of CIDs and this tells the server to send more, but the server has no idea how many. By contrast, the DTLS design is for the client to tell the server when it wants more CIDs and the server gets to retire them. ISTM that this is a more flexible design in that the server can change CIDs whenever it wants (e.g., for rekeying of the CID encryption key).\r\n\r\nIIRC much of the motivation for the design with QUIC was not to have to interlock with the ACK, and in this respect the situation here is the same as with the KeyUpdate, which is that the QUIC design has the advantage that it doesn't need to interlock with the ACK to know when things have change. But that doesn't apply here for the same reason as with #63.\r\n\r\nSo I think my proposed resolution is just to add that you should change CIDs whenever you change paths and should request enough CIDs that you have a hot spare. I could imagine a way for the server to say what specific keys it wants to invalidate, but I'm not sure that's necessary. I do think we should enhance RequestConnectionId to have a count.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "I think that we can do better.  I've just opened #58.  That uses all the bits in that first octet, which would seem to be a regression, but there are two ways in which we could get another bit back.\r\n\r\nThe first option is to drop the S-bit I propose and have sequence numbers be 16 bits always.  I'd be sad that we lost the small optimization, but that isn't the end of the world.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a better option is to drop the second epoch bit.  This seems like a bad idea because you potentially have multiple epochs inbound to a server during a 0-RTT handshake.  In that case, you have to distinguish between ClientHello (001 or 0011 would work for that), 0-RTT (epoch 1), Handshake (epoch 2), and the ultimate Application Data (epoch 3).  If you only have one bit of epoch, then 1 and 3 are indistinguishable.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you look at the way we handle 0-RTT in stacks, it might be OK to allow those late-arriving 0-RTT records to be dropped.  For instance, NSS processes 0-RTT and handshake linearly.  We don't read the Finished until we have the EndOfEarlyData, and as soon as we process the EOED, we stop accepting new 0-RTT.  Part of the reason for this is that once we report handshake success, we don't provide any other signal to an application about the data it receives.  So, for NSS, dropping 0-RTT when 1-RTT is available wouldn't change anything for us.\r\n\r\nThe final option is to not worry about this.  The codepoints are there to use.  The number of public bits we have is small, and we don't need to signal content type in the clear any more.  As I suggested in discussing tlswg/dtls-conn-id#11, perhaps the right answer is to backport the TLS 1.3 record format to DTLS 1.2 and use only one codepoint.",

Losing the ability to signal 8- v 16-bits sequence would be a bit of a shame, especially in constrained networks (@hannestschofenig, opinions?), but I agree with you it's not the end of the world and I'd be more than happy to immolate it to get one of the reserved bits back.  In fact, one bit is sufficient to build a whole [header extension machinery](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-fossati-tls-ext-header-01.txt) if we'd need to -- for spin bit, VEC, etc. I value that much more than a tiny optimisation.\r\n\r\nWRT 2. Your argument in favour of dropping the second epoch bit is pretty convincing, so personally I'd be OK with one-bit epoch.\r\n \r\nSo, I guess we could have something like:\r\n```\r\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\n|0|0|1|1|C|L|E|X|\r\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\r\nC - CID present\r\nL - Length present\r\nE - Epoch\r\nX - reserved\r\n```\r\nand 16 bits sequence, always?",

So while in general, I think it's good for QUIC and DTLS to have similar mechanisms, in this case I think the current design is the right one for DTLS.\r\n\r\n",

I think that it says that the client, having received a bad cookie will send its second ClientHello off into the void, only to have the handshake time out.  Then, the client is expected to restart.\r\n\r\nThis is probably right.  The bad cookie indicates that something is badly wrong.  Anything the server might send that would fix this wouldn't be authenticated and so might be exploited by an attack as a denial of service on the connection.

However, that represents an attack and a DTLS 1.3 server shouldn't continue to establish the connection.  Maybe it isn't a bad attack because the client doesn't change its posture in ways that would materially affect the resulting session, but we have generally tried to avoid these.",

We don't account for this in terms of the limits on key usage, so yes, it would benefit from some analysis.\r\n\r\nI don't think that this is a risk in that we are not using that key so much, and the sample - 128 bits - is large enough that we don't get near the birthday bound.  Neither protection model uses 96-bit inputs.\r\n\r\nIf we model the underlying block cipher as an ideal PRP (as the papers I've read do), then we only need to worry about collision risk, which isn't so bad.  The advantage reduces to approximately `q^2/2^128` then, which is 2^-32 for DTLS after all record numbers are used.  Even QUIC avoids hitting 0.5 on that basis, though I'll concede that it comes closer than might be ideal, but that's a lot of packets to cross-match.\r\n\r\nWith a collision, the attacker gains the ability to derive the XOR of two record sequence numbers (in QUIC, this includes a little more stuff).  This likely allows the attacker to confirm what the values of both values are.  It might also allow them to confirm a guess that two records sent on different paths (with different connection IDs) are for the same connection.\r\n\r\nMulti-user analysis could be interesting here to, but I think that it turns into a `q^2/2^(k + n)` formula as a result, which would even less of a worry.\r\n\r\nThis is pretty rough, but I don't think that it's particularly exciting.  I'd support adding a note saying that we don't know the confidentiality bounds are for multiple applications of RNE.",

The latter has changed compared to DTLS 1.2 and does not carry version information anymore. We kept the plaintext version to ensure backwards compatibility with earlier versions of DTLS. We could put a new version number in there but we follow the spirit of TLS 1.3 and put the DTLS 1.2 version number in the legacy_record_version field ({254, 253}). \r\n\r\n* Handshake Protocol\r\nWe wanted to keep alignment with TLS 1.3 and therefore the content of the supported_versions counts. Currently, we are using 0x0304 there for DTLS 1.3. For the handshake protocol we again use the spirit of TLS 1.3 and put the DTLS 1.2 version into the legacy_version into the ClientHello (which is {254, 253}). For the ServerHello we use the TLS 1.3 ServerHello.legacy_version field (which is 0x0303) for the case where the server decides to use DTLS 1.3. One could argue that we should instead put {254, 253} in there as well.\r\n\r\nThe important aspect is that the version field in the record protocol and in the handshake protocol does not matter when two DTLS 1.3 peers talk to each other. They are irrelevant constants used in the code. For cTLS we are getting rid of them. For a dual-stack environment, however, it matters what is contained in the ClientHello and in the plaintext field of the record protocol (because of backwards compability reasons).\r\n\r\nMaybe we could make it more explicit what goes where and what the design rational is but setting the values differently does not matter much at all.

When the server receives the retransmission, it\r\n   knows to retransmit.\r\n\r\nFP: It would be good to mention retransmission max times here.\r\n\r\n3. -----\r\n\r\n                |                |   /+----------------+\\\r\n                | 31 < OCT < 64 -+--> |DTLS Ciphertext |\r\n                |                |    |(header bits    |\r\n                |      else      |    | start with 001)|\r\n                |       |        |   /+-------+--------+\\\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   26.

IANA is requested to\r\n   reserve the content type range 32-63 so that content types in this\r\n   range are not allocated.\r\n\r\nFP: IANA is asked to reserve 32-63, but I could not see any explanation for that. I would like to see it justified in section 4.1 or in the respective IANA section.\r\n\r\n4. -----\r\n\r\n   fragmentation, clients of the DTLS record layer SHOULD attempt to\r\n   size records so that they fit within any PMTU estimates obtained from\r\n   the record layer.\r\n\r\nFP: First time PMTU appears, please expand and add reference.\r\n\r\n5. -----\r\n\r\n   performing PMTU discovery, whether via [RFC1191] or [RFC4821]\r\n   mechanisms.

That is, limits MUST\r\n   be specified for the number of packets that can be authenticated and\r\n   for the number of packets that can fail authentication before a key\r\n   update is required.

      "body": "Thanks for this document -- badly needed and easy to read.\r\n\r\nThanks also to Bernard Adoba for his recent tsvart review. I support his comments.\r\n\r\nCOMMENTS:\r\nSec 2. It might be useful to introduce the term \"epoch\" in the glossary, for those who read this front to back.\r\n\r\nSec 4.2.3: \"The encrypted sequence number is computed by XORing the leading bytes of the Mask with the sequence number. Decryption is accomplished by the same process.\"\r\n\r\nThe text is unclear if the XOR is applied to the expanded sequence number or merely the 1-2 octets on the wire. I presume it's the latter, but this should be clarified.\r\n\r\nSec 4.2.3: It's implied here that the sn_key rotates with the epoch. As this is different from QUIC, it's probably worth spelling out.\r\n\r\nSec 5.1 is a bit vague about the amplification limit; why not at least RECOMMEND 3, as we've converged on this elsewhere?\r\n\r\nSec 5.1. Reading between the lines, it's clear that the cookie can't be used as address verification across connections in the way that a NEW_TOKEN token is. It would be good to spell this out for clients -- use the resumption token or whatever instead.\r\n\r\nSec 7.2 \"As noted above, the receipt of any record responding to a given flight MUST be taken as an implicit acknowledgement for the entire flight.\" I think this should be s/entire flight/entire previous flight?\r\n\r\nSec 7.2 \"Upon receipt of an ACK that leaves it with only some messages from a flight having been acknowledged an implementation SHOULD retransmit the unacknowledged messages or fragments.\"\r\n\r\nThis language appears inconsistent with Figure 12, where Record 1 has not been acknowledged but is also not retransmitted. It appears there is an implied handling of empty ACKs that isn't written down anywhere in Sec 7.2\r\n\r\nSec 9. Should there be any flow control limits on new_connection_id? Or should receivers be free to simply drop CIDs they can't handle? It might be good to specify.\r\n\r\nFinally, a really weird one. Reading this document and references to connection ID prompted to me to think how QUIC-LB could apply to DTLS. The result is here: https://github.com/quicwg/load-balancers/pull/106/files. Please note the rather unfortunate third-to-last paragraph. I'm happy to take the answer that this use case doesn't matter, since I made it up today. But if it does, it would be very helpful if (1) DTLS 1.3 clients MUST include a connection_id extension in their ClientHello, even if zero length, and/or (2) this draft updated 4.1.4 of 8446 to allow the server to include connection_id in HelloRetryRequest even if the client didn't offer it. Thoughts?\r\n\r\nNITS:\r\n5.2 s/select(HandshakeType)/select(msg_type). Though with pseudocode your mileage may vary as to what's clearer.\r\n\r\n5.7 s/consitute/constitute\r\n\r\nSec 5.7 In table 1, why include one ACK in the diagram but not the other? It's clear from the note, but the figure is a weird omission.",

These comments were written\r\nprimarily for the transport area directors, but are copied to the document's\r\nauthors and WG to allow them to address any issues raised and also to the IETF\r\ndiscussion list for information.\r\n\r\nWhen done at the time of IETF Last Call, the authors should consider this\r\nreview as part of the last-call comments they receive. Please always CC\r\ntsv-art@ietf.org if you reply to or forward this review.\r\n\r\nTSV-ART Review of draft-ietf-tls-dtls13-41\r\nReviewer: Bernard Aboba\r\n\r\nSummary: The timeout and retransmission scheme looks workable for common cases, but could use some refinement to make it more robust. \r\n\r\nTechnical Comments\r\n\r\n4.5.2.  Handling Invalid Records\r\n\r\n   Unlike TLS, DTLS is resilient in the face of invalid records (e.g.,\r\n   invalid formatting, length, MAC, etc.).  In general, invalid records\r\n   SHOULD be silently discarded, thus preserving the association;\r\n   however, an error MAY be logged for diagnostic purposes.\r\n\r\n[BA] How does silent discard of invalid records interact with retransmission timers? \r\n\r\n   Implementations which choose to generate an alert instead, MUST\r\n   generate error alerts to avoid attacks where the attacker repeatedly\r\n   probes the implementation to see how it responds to various types of\r\n   error.  Note that if DTLS is run over UDP, then any implementation\r\n   which does this will be extremely susceptible to denial-of-service\r\n   (DoS) attacks because UDP forgery is so easy.  Thus, this practice is\r\n   NOT RECOMMENDED for such transports, both to increase the reliability\r\n   of DTLS service and to avoid the risk of spoofing attacks sending\r\n   traffic to unrelated third parties.\r\n\r\n[BA] \"this practice\" refers to \"generate an alert instead\", correct?\r\n\r\n5.8.2.  Timer Values\r\n\r\n   Though timer values are the choice of the implementation, mishandling\r\n   of the timer can lead to serious congestion problems, for example if\r\n\r\n[BA] Saying \"timer values are the choice of the implementation\" seems\r\nodd, because it is followed by normative language. I would delete this\r\nand start the sentence with \"Mishandling...\". \r\n\r\n   many instances of a DTLS time out early and retransmit too quickly on\r\n   a congested link.  Implementations SHOULD use an initial timer value\r\n   of 100 msec (the minimum defined in RFC 6298 [RFC6298]) and double\r\n   the value at each retransmission, up to no less than 60 seconds (the\r\n   RFC 6298 maximum).  Application specific profiles, such as those used\r\n   for the Internet of Things environment, may recommend longer timer\r\n   values.  Note that a 100 msec timer is recommended rather than the\r\n   3-second RFC 6298 default in order to improve latency for time-\r\n   sensitive applications.  Because DTLS only uses retransmission for\r\n   handshake and not dataflow, the effect on congestion should be\r\n   minimal.\r\n\r\n   Implementations SHOULD retain the current timer value until a message\r\n   is transmitted and acknowledged without having to be retransmitted,\r\n   at which time the value may be reset to the initial value.  \r\n\r\n[BA] Is it always possible to distinguish a retransmission from a late\r\narrival of an original packet? This seems like it could result in\r\nwrongly resetting the timer in some situations. \r\n\r\n5.8.3.  Large Flight Sizes\r\n\r\n   DTLS does not have any built-in congestion control or rate control;\r\n   in general this is not an issue because messages tend to be small.\r\n   However, in principle, some messages - especially Certificate - can\r\n   be quite large.  If all the messages in a large flight are sent at\r\n   once, this can result in network congestion.  A better strategy is to\r\n   send out only part of the flight, sending more when messages are\r\n   acknowledged.  DTLS offers a number of mechanisms for minimizing the\r\n   size of the certificate message, including the cached information\r\n   extension [RFC7924] and certificate compression [RFC8879].\r\n\r\n[BA] How does the implementation know how much of the flight to send? \r\nNot sure how prevalent large certs are for DTLS  (e.g. compared with the self-signed certs of WebRTC),\r\nbut in EAP-TLS deployments, large certs have caused problems. \r\nThe  EAP-TLS cert document draft-ietf-emu-eaptlscert cites some additional\r\nmechanisms for reducing certificate sizes, such as draft-ietf-tls-ctls\r\nand [RFC6066] which defines the \"client_certificate_url\" \r\nextension which allows TLS clients to send a sequence of Uniform \r\nResource Locators (URLs) instead of the client certificate. \r\n\r\n5.11.  Alert Messages\r\n\r\n   Note that Alert messages are not retransmitted at all, even when they\r\n   occur in the context of a handshake.  However, a DTLS implementation\r\n   which would ordinarily issue an alert SHOULD generate a new alert\r\n   message if the offending record is received again (e.g., as a\r\n   retransmitted handshake message).  Implementations SHOULD detect when\r\n   a peer is persistently sending bad messages and terminate the local\r\n   connection state after such misbehavior is detected.  Note that\r\n   alerts are not reliably transmitted; implementation SHOULD NOT depend\r\n   on receiving alerts in order to signal errors or connection closure.\r\n\r\n[BA] For the fatal alert case, it does seem like retransmission would\r\nbe a good idea; otherwise the peer can be left hanging. \r\n\r\nSection 7.1\r\n\"Disruptions\" such as reordering do not affect timers, correct? \r\n\r\n   ACKs SHOULD NOT be sent for these flights unless generating the\r\n   responding flight takes significant time.\r\n\r\nWhat is \"significant time\"? \r\n\r\nEditorial Comments (NITs)\r\n\r\nSection 2\r\n\r\n   The reader is also as to be familiar with\r\n\r\n[BA] \"as\" -> \"assumed\" \r\n\r\nSection 3\r\n\r\n   The basic design philosophy of DTLS is to construct \"TLS over\r\n   datagram transport\".  Datagram transport does not require nor provide\r\n   reliable or in-order delivery of data.  The DTLS protocol preserves\r\n   this property for application data.  Applications such as media\r\n   streaming, Internet telephony, and online gaming use datagram\r\n   transport for communication due to the delay-sensitive nature of\r\n   transported data.  The behavior of such applications is unchanged\r\n   when the DTLS protocol is used to secure communication, since the\r\n   DTLS protocol does not compensate for lost or reordered data traffic.\r\n\r\n[BA] While low-latency streaming and gaming does use DTLS to protect data (e.g. for \r\nprotection of WebRTC data channel), telephony and RTC Audio/Video uses DTLS/SRTP for\r\nkey derivation only, and SRTP for protection of data. So you might want to make a\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\nSection 3.1\r\n\r\n   Note that timeout and retransmission do not apply to the\r\n   HelloRetryRequest since this would require creating state on the\r\n   server.  The HelloRetryRequest is designed to be small enough that it\r\n   will not itself be fragmented, thus avoiding concerns about\r\n   interleaving multiple HelloRetryRequests.\r\n\r\n[BA] I would add \"For more detail on timeouts and retransmission, \r\nsee Section 5.8.\"\r\n\r\n4.3.  Transport Layer Mapping\r\n\r\n   DTLS messages MAY be fragmented into multiple DTLS records.  Each\r\n   DTLS record MUST fit within a single datagram.  In order to avoid IP\r\n   fragmentation, clients of the DTLS record layer SHOULD attempt to\r\n   size records so that they fit within any PMTU estimates obtained from\r\n   the record layer.\r\n\r\n[BA] You might reference PMTU considerations described in Section 4.4.\r\n\r\n   5.  Post-handshake client authentication\r\n\r\n   Messages of each category can be sent independently, and reliability\r\n   is established via independent state machines each of which behaves\r\n   as described in Section 5.8.1.  For example, if a server sends a\r\n   NewSessionTicket and a CertificateRequest message, two independent\r\n   state machines will be created.\r\n\r\n   As explained in the corresponding sections, sending multiple\r\n   instances of messages of a given category without having completed\r\n   earlier transmissions is allowed for some categories, but not for\r\n   others.  Specifically, a server MAY send multiple NewSessionTicket\r\n   messages at once without awaiting ACKs for earlier NewSessionTicket\r\n   first.  Likewise, a server MAY send multiple CertificateRequest\r\n   messages at once without having completed earlier client\r\n   authentication requests before.  In contrast, implementations MUST\r\n   NOT have send KeyUpdate, NewConnectionId or RequestConnectionId\r\n\r\n[BA] \"send\" -> \"sent\"\r\n\r\n\r\n6.  Example of Handshake with Timeout and Retransmission\r\n\r\n   The following is an example of a handshake with lost packets and\r\n   retransmissions.  Note that the client sends an empty ACK message\r\n   because it can only acknowledge Record 1 sent by the server once it\r\n   has processed messages in Record 0 needed to establish epoch 2 keys,\r\n   which are needed to encrypt to decrypt messages found in Record 1.\r\n\r\n[BA] \"encrypt to decrypt\" -> \"encrypt or decrypt\"?\r\n \r\nSection 7.3\r\n\r\n   In the first case the use of the ACK message is optional because the\r\n   peer will retransmit in any case and therefore the ACK just allows\r\n   for selective retransmission, as opposed to the whole flight\r\n   retransmission in previous versions of DTLS.  For instance in the\r\n   flow shown in Figure 11 if the client does not send the ACK message\r\n\r\n[BA] Figure 11 is the DTLS State Machine. Are you referring to another figure? \r\n\r\n   The use of the ACK for the second case is mandatory for the proper\r\n   functioning of the protocol.  For instance, the ACK message sent by\r\n   the client in Figure 13, acknowledges receipt and processing of\r\n   record 4 (containing the NewSessionTicket message) and if it is not\r\n   sent the server will continue retransmission of the NewSessionTicket\r\n   indefinitely until its transmission cap is reached.\r\n\r\n[BA] Do you mean \"maximum retransmission timemout value\"?",

If there is enough space (PMTU-wise) then it may be good in some cases to wait until a number of messages are ready for transmission.

We think this quite easily solves all the problems we had without requiring any updates of DTLS 1.3. It also makes DTLS/SCTP less dependant on version specific DTLS mechanisms. It will hopefully work without changes with any future DTLS 1.4.\r\n\r\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tsvwg-dtls-over-sctp-bis/\r\n\r\nWe can now firmly RECOMMEND DTLS 1.3 which I think is very important. 5G is to a large degree replacing or complementing IPsec with TLS, DTLS, and DTLS/SCTP. I will do my best to transition 3GPP to DTLS 1.3 asap.\r\n\r\nFYI, 3GPP DTLS/SCTP associations have very long lifetimes (can be years), strive for five nines (99.999%) availability and cannot be teared down without causing major disruptions. With such long lifetimes we think mutual reauthentication, rekeying of the SCTP-AUTH key, and forcing attackers to dynamic key exfiltration [RFC7624] are required features.\r\n\r\nI still think #255 should be done. 2^40.5 packets is quite limiting.",

As @ekr points out there are two different epochs to consider, using them both in the exporter could maybe lead to synchronization problems. It also does not provide the security properties of current IPsec deployments where attackers are forced to do dynamic key exfiltration instead of just static key exfiltration [RFC7624]. For very long-lived connections I think dynamic key exfiltration is a must. I think we can probably close this issue.",

It has been argued by Ekr that such should be discouraged because they aren't efficient. On the other hand, as Rich Salz remarks, the choice of reassembly mechanism isn't something the peer could tell (the effects of poor reassembly performance are more retransmissions, which could also be due to poor network reliability), so it does feel like we're overspecifying things here. Weakening the MUST to a SHOULD isn't good either as it allows dropping fragments altogether. There's a tension between the desire for a concrete operational guidance, which the current text clearly provides, and a more abstract formulation along the line of \"implementations MUST use a reassembly scheme ensuring forward progress\". \r\n\r\nAs suggested by Ekr, taking this off the mailing list and continuing discussion here.\r\n\r\nTo be clear: This has no bearing on the protocol itself, it's about how much implementation details the spec should enforce.",

In general, invalid records SHOULD be silently discarded, thus preserving the association; [...]\r\n\r\nThis recommendation is not great, particularly as it attached to the preceding list, which is a little non-specific.\r\n\r\nQuoting @dennisjackson from another context:\r\n\r\n> I do still think the phrasing in 4.5.2 is needlessly hostile by introducing the concept of an invalid record in the first place. If we asked implementers which of the following are considered invalid records, I'd suspect they'd say \"all of them\":\r\n> \r\n>  * A record which consists of a zero length handshake message\r\n>  * A record which contains a fragment of an alert message (or two alert messages).\r\n>  * A record of application data which appears between two records of a fragmented handshake message.\r\n>  * A record which has an invalid inner content type.\r\n>  * A record which has an invalid outer content type.\r\n>\r\n> I do think 4.5.2 would be significantly clearer if it didn't mention \"invalid records\" at all and just spoke about \"errors arising from record handling\".\r\n\r\nTo this point, it would be clearer if the spec were more definitive.  Records that do not authenticate would always be discarded (i.e., use MUST) and records that do authenticate, but are otherwise invalid, result in fatal alerts always (i.e., use MUST).  I don't see much value in having ambiguous language for something so important.\r\n",

I agree this text could be better, and as you suggest, this was intended to cover errors at the record layer (which was of course somewhat simpler in TLS 1.2). I agree with the resolution you propose but you omit the question of plaintext records. My sense is that they should be treated as authenticated for the purpose above. My reasoning for this is that there are three basic ways to get something that is malformed.\r\n\r\n- The peer generated invalid data.\r\n- Some kind of unintentional mangling (e.g., a bit error)\r\n- Deliberate mangling by an attacker (yes, I realize that the line between these last two is not as clear as one would like).\r\n\r\nThe primary reason to have DTLS discard malformed data is to make it difficult for attackers to DoS a DTLS connection the way they can with TLS. However, the attacker can obviously manipulate unprotected records and DoS the connection, so discarding them if they are malformed doesn't help that much. One could of course say that you're also worried about unintentional damage to the handshake but the UDP checksum makes that comparatively rare, so it's not clear it's worth the effort.\r\n\r\nWith all that said, we already published 9147, so it's a bit unobvious what to do about this.

This\r\n  avoids the need to ack ACKs or worry about reassembling\r\n  when ACKs are lost.\r\n\r\n- The receipt of a flight also counts as an implicit ACK and\r\n  so you shouldn't ACK full flights. I tried removing this\r\n  feature but it leads to weird anomalies where you have\r\n  two flights you should be retransmitting if the ACKs get\r\n  lost.\r\n\r\n- ACKs are always encrypted with the then-current key.\r\n\r\n- I also removed the rule that you don't stop retransmitting\r\n  when you receive a partial flight. That was intended to have\r\n  fast retransmission for missing messages because the retransmit\r\n  of flight A triggered retransmission of partial flight B, but\r\n  ACKs serve this purpose.",

Commonly the retransmission timer(ie: RTO timer) is based on the delayed ack time, so I think basing the delayed ack timer on smoothed RTT or another RTT based metric is wiser than specifying it from a retransmit timer, assuming that's possible.\r\n\r\n1/4 RTT seems like a good recommendation for most RTTs, though for very small RTTs, this could be very small, particularly if it's smaller than the timer granularity.

In the 5 bits that\r\nwe have, we can pack two epoch bits (we only need one in practice, but\r\nlet's leave that aside for the moment), and a bit each to signal\r\npresence of connection ID and length.  That leaves one spare bit.  I'm\r\nsuggesting that we spend this on signaling the difference between an\r\n8-bit and 16-bit sequence number.  16 bits is far more comfortable than\r\n14, and 8 is probably enough for many use cases (saving a byte).\r\n\r\nThat is, unless you were saving this for a spin bit and VEC.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't do anything about #56, but I think that we can save a bit\r\nfrom the epoch.

Reword it.\r\n\r\n- Whether there's a Certificate message is no longer a function of the\r\n  ciphersuite, but of parameters in general. (With resumption that was\r\n  already true.)\r\n\r\n- The bits talking about epoch 1-3 so far before the definitions of\r\n  those epochs should link to the section.\r\n\r\n- Remove some remnants of EndOfEarlyData. They're still in the\r\n  definition of the Handshake struct.

          "body": "I think the underlying issue here is the conception that all that needs to be ensured is the ability to ACK \r\nretransmissions of the KeyUpdate, and the modified version still gives that impression. If that was true, \r\nthe use of 'canned ACKs' as in Draft 37 would be fine. However, the example from the list shows that there's more to retaining old keying material than just ACKing retransmitted KeyUpdates, and I'd therefore opt for a more intrusive change of wording, such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDue to the possibility of an ACK message for a KeyUpdate being lost and thereby\r\npreventing the sender of the KeyUpdate from updating its keying material,\r\nreceivers MUST retain the pre-update keying material until receipt and successful\r\ndecryption of a message using the new keys. Receivers MUST NOT delete the\r\npre-update keying material immediately and use canned ACK messages for\r\nretransmitted KeyUpdate messages, since situations can occur in which receivers\r\nstill need to be able to decrypt messages secured with pre-update keying material.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat do you think, @hannestschofenig ?",

For some applications with very small packet sizes, the derived recommendations in terms of packet numbers will therefore be unnecessarily strict. Given that the derived constraints are of practical relevance, I wonder if it's worth stating the analysis in terms of total number of blocks, and derive a less precise but safe bound in terms of the number of packets from that.

DTLS associations are supposed to be robust against injected packets.\r\n\r\nI suspect that there is also some remnant of the previous state of affairs when just incrementing the epoch was all that was needed to generate new keys, as opposed to requiring KeyUpdate+ACK, though that's not directly related to making this change.",

This should likely contain the full epoch\r\n\r\n- It changes the 64-bit \"record_sequence_number\". This PR suggest the 64 low order bits of the RecordNumber.\r\nI think it could also be set to 0x0000 || sequence_number. I don't think epoch is needed here as the keys are\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nNote that a 32-bit epoch still limits the number of packets in a AES-GCM connection compared to what is allowed in DTLS 1.2.\r\n2^56.6 compared to 2^64. 2^56.5 is likely enough for all use cases but epoch could also be made even larger 2^48 or 2^64.",
